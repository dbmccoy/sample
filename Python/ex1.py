#Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.
#Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will
#turn 100 years old.

#Extras:

#Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number and
#printing out that many copies of the previous message.
#(Hint: order of operations exists in Python)

#Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines.
#(Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)
